For anyone checking this out: this is a game project I worked on in high school. Forgive some of the hack job that is the codebase, I was young and working off a template that I didn't understand. However, overall I think it works surprisingly well! If you want to try it out, you can do so at https://zombiesmash-ae858.web.app/



Game Design Specification below:

In this game, you are an expert zombie hunter who is killing vast numbers of zombies. There will be several levels where wave after wave of zombies appear around you. The game has a top-down view with WASD controls to move, Q and E to rotate, and the spacebar to attack. The game can be played as multiplayer, in which case a second character will be on screen. The screen will not be split. The second character uses arrowkey controls to move, , and . to rotate, and option or COMMAND to attack. If players are playing multiplayer, spawn twice as many zombies per level and average the luck stats of the two players to determine the drop rate. If a player dies, they cannot play for the rest of the level. If all players die, the players lose the game. If there are two players, they CAN damage each other. The game should have all its essential data saved in a cookie so you can pick up where you left off if you close your browser.

Killing zombies has a chance to drop DNA. In between levels, there will be an upgrade screen in which various character traits can be upgraded by doing research spending zombie DNA. The traits are as follows: Strength (defines a damage multiplier, starts at 1. DEFINE A METER AS THE DISTANCE IT TAKES A CHARACTER WITH SPEED 1 CAN MOVE IN 1 SECOND), Speed(defines a move speed, starts at 1), HP (defines how many times you can be hit, starts at 100), and Luck (%chance for zombies drop DNA, starts at 10). A character also has a weapon. A weapon determines how much damage a character does. A character’s starting weapon is a club  (melee) , which deals 20*STR damage in a cone in front of player with radius 1 and angle 90°, knocks back all zombies hit,  and has a 1 second cooldown. Character has 3 weapon slots. They can cycle through them by pressing TAB. Player 2 can cycle between their weapons by pressing ENTER. The player’s current weapon, the amount of ammo it has, the amount of clips they have for it, their HP, and the amount of DNA they have should be displayed in the corner of the screen. A weapon which does not require ammo is assumed to have infinite ammo.



Zombies:
The zombies each have 100+2*level HP. When a zombie is hit, it is VeRy important to the fun of the game that they make an incredibly satisfying crunching sound, especially when they die. Preferably, they would also spray blood particles everywhere. Their weapon is their hands, which deals 20+1*level damage to a character upon hitting and has a 2 second cooldown. They have a speed of .25. Zombies will try to walk in the straightest path towards the player at all times. Zombies and characters cannot occupy the same space; if they attempt to move into a space occupied by a character, they don't.




Research/shop screen:
Player 1's research screen will be displayed first. When they click done, Player 2's will be displayed, if there is a player 2. The research shop is navigated by mouse.
Research must be purchased sequentially. Only the next upgrade need be displayed on the screen.
The research screen will have the following upgrades:

Levels: Each level should have between (20+5*level and  30+5*level) zombies that spawn randomly on the map at random times over the course of 2 minutes. There can be endless levels. A level ends when either all zombies or all players are dead. Starting at Level 21, there is a (-1000/(x-11)+100)% chance that the HEAD HONCHO will spawn after 2 minutes. This is a zombie with Speed .5, 1000 HP, And a melee attack that does 50 when it hits the player with a 2 second cooldown. HEAD HONCHO can also spawn 5 normal zombies in a circle around him every 10 seconds. When the players kills HEAD HONCHO, they win the game.
